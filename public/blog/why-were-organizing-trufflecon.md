## Why TruffleCon?

A reasonable question to ask is, why a conference?

There is certainly no shortage of conferences related to Ethereum. [Ethereal](https://etherealsummit.com) recently wrapped up in New York City, and [Devcon](https://devcon.ethereum.org) is ramping up in Prague later on this year. There's also [EDCON](https://edcon.io), [EthCC](https://ethcc.io), and plenty more, especially when you count those that intersect with the larger blockchain space.

And yet, these events all have a focus on the larger ecosystem. What about the people who are deep in the trenches, building the dapps and deploying the contracts? Where is the conference where the focus is solely on development?

**We want TruffleCon to be the place for people who are doing the building.**

Also, many developers are working in silos, connected to other teams only by GitHub, Gitter, StackExchange, Reddit, or other "[weak ties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_ties)". **We want to strengthen those connections to bring people together**.

We want people to share their ideas, and talk about their successes and challenges. We want people to promote their projects, of course, and professional networking is always a part of these events, but more than anything else, **we want people to be heard**.

As Truffle founder Tim Coulter, says:

## Why now?

We've noticed a shift over the past year or so in the usage of Truffle.

Whereas many of the comments and requests in [our Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ConsenSys/truffle) and GitHub issues were originally regarding local tests, and in sandboxes, we noticed more and more people deploying their contracts to the public test networks and even the mainnet. While this, of course, was always the intention, it shows that **confidence in our tools and the Ethereum ecosystem is growing**.

**We want to help people "go live".** And so we believe that there has never been a better time than now.


## Why Portland?

And as for why Portland, it's a vibrant city full of world-class food and drink, unmatched outdoor opportunities, and an excellent transportation system for ease in getting where you need to go. If you've never been, you're missing out.
